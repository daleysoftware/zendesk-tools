<h2>How Do I Access My Files From The Web? </h2>
<p>You can access your files from your AeroFS&nbsp;<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/articles/201439434-AeroFS-Web-Admin-Panel">Web Admin Panel</a> by clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>My Files</strong>&nbsp;link.

<h2>How Do I Enable API Access on the Hybrid Cloud?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-size: small; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #fafafa;">The AeroFS API is used to download and upload content stored on your devices running AeroFS. The API pulls files from either a team server or devices linked to your AeroFS user ID.

<h2>Why Can't I Share Sub-Folders Of A Shared Folder?</h2>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">Sharing&nbsp;a sub-folder of a shared folder is not supported by AeroFS. For example, if there is a shared folder called "Projects" and a sub-folder called "Marketing", you can't share "Marketing" because it's parent folder ("Projects") is already shared. If you wish to share a sub-folder separately, simply move it outside of the shared parent folder before sharing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The reason why sharing a sub-folder of a shared folder is not supported is because if the system inherits access permissions to sub-folders folders from the parent folder,&nbsp;</span><font color="#444444" face="Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12px;">severe security issues may arise. For instance, users would be able to arbitrarily override permissions by moving shared folders with less permissions into a folder with more permissions, and thereby gain access to data that they were not intended to have access to.</span></font></p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">Another scenario to consider is the case where you have folder F shared with User A and sub-folder G shared with User B. In this case, should User A have access to sub-folder G? In the past we have had mixed responses to this question with one half of our user base saying User A should have access to sub-folder G and the other half saying User A should not have access. In any case, both choices pose potential usability issues, so we decided to disallow sharing a sub-folder of a shared folder altogether. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Is AeroFS supported on Windows Vista? </h2>
<p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Yes, AeroFS is supported on&nbsp;Windows Vista. However when you download and run the AeroFS installation file, AeroFS setup will&nbsp;not launch. This is because Windows Vista marks the AeroFS installer as untrusted and blocks it. In order to work around this, simply <strong>right-click</strong>&nbsp;on the installer file, select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>, click on&nbsp;<strong>Unblock</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom as shown in the image below and run the installation file again.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200651594/Screen_Shot_2014-05-08_at_1.07.06_PM.png" alt="" width="356" height="452" /></p>
<p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>This behavior is specific to Windows Vista only.</p>

<h2>What Does The 'Max 3 Users' Condition Mean In The Personal Hybrid Cloud Plan? </h2>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">The <a href="https://aerofs.com/pricing/">Personal Hybrid Cloud Plan</a> is free&nbsp;for the first three<strong>&nbsp;</strong>users in your organization - after that you will be upgraded to the Professional Hybrid Cloud Plan at a rate of $10/user/month. You can determine how many users are&nbsp;in your organization by logging into your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/201439434-AeroFS-Web-Admin-Panel">Web Admin Panel</a> and clicking on <strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;under the <strong>My Organization</strong>&nbsp;section, as shown in the image&nbsp;below.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;">By default, if you are the Administrator of your organization, you are already a member of the organization. This means you can invite two other people to your organization for free. The main benefits of adding users to an organization are the ability to automatically back up and sync members' data via the AeroFS <a href="https://aerofs.com/team-server/">Team Server&nbsp;</a>and manage users via your Web Admin Panel. If you want to invite a fourth user to your organization, you will need to upgrade to the Professional Hybrid Cloud Plan and the cost will be $40/month and every additional user will be an extra $10/month, as shown in the table below.</p>
<table width="487">

<p>This is not to be confused with sharing files/folders with other users. There are no limits to how many users you can invite to a shared folder under the Personal or Professional Plan. In other words you can share files/folders with an unlimited number of people outside your AeroFS Organization for free&nbsp;- the caveat here is that their data will not sync to any of your Team Server&nbsp;instances&nbsp;and you will not be able to manage them via your Web Admin Panel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What Is The Difference Between The Canary and Stable Release Channel? </h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">The purpose of having a Canary and a Stable Release Channel is to improve product stability when we push new updates. The Canary release is a much newer release that is not tested as thoroughly as the Stable release, so it can be vulnerable to failures.&nbsp;Therefore the Canary release is mainly designed for developers and early adopters. The Canary release will also get more frequent updates than the Stable release.&nbsp;Once a Canary release becomes stable, it gets pushed to the Stable Release Channel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Release Channel</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Your AeroFS Desktop Client will be set to run the Stable release by default. If you want to explore the latest and greatest features AeroFS has to offer, simply click on the <strong>AeroFS icon</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Preferences&nbsp;</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Advanced </strong>and select&nbsp;<strong>Canary </strong>in the drop-down list next to&nbsp;<strong>Release channel</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200623494/canary.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium" style="font-size: 11px;">After you choose the Canary release, your AeroFS Desktop Client might restart after updating to the latest Canary release.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>After upgrading to the latest Canary release, you can always select the Stable release; however your desktop client will not be updated to a Stable release until the currently installed Canary release is pushed out as a Stable release. Do not attempt to downgrade to a previous Stable version, as doing so will cause unexpected behavior and potential data loss.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Canary Once</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium">The <strong>Canary Once</strong> option is similar to selecting the Canary Release Channel - the only difference is that it is a <strong>one-time </strong>update to the Canary release. Once the current Canary release is pushed to the Stable release, the desktop client will automatically switch back to the Stable release. This option is intended to give users early access to specific features or bug fixes related to customer support requests, while minimizing the risk of continued use of unstable releases. It is not recommended to exercise this option unless advised to do so by one of our Customer Service Representatives.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What are the implications of enabling API access on the AeroFS Hybrid Cloud?</h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Things to consider when enabling or disabling AeroFS API Access on the Hybrid Cloud:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">AeroFS API Access must be enabled to allow authenticated users to access shared files from anywhere using the web client or mobile app.</span></li>
<li><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">In order to deliver your files from AeroFS desktop clients to your web browser or mobile app, the files need to be transmitted to the AeroFS servers over a secure encrypted connection before being transmitted to you over a different secure and encrypted connection. As a result, anytime you upload or download a file using the API, there will be a brief window of time during which our API server can see your data.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Note: We do not store any of your data on our servers at any given point in time. Please see our support article on <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23728686-What-information-is-stored-on-the-AeroFS-servers">data storage</a> for more details. </span></p>

<h2>How do I assign roles to members of a shared folder?</h2>
<p>Users of shared folders have three roles, or three levels of access, to shared folders. &nbsp;The roles are <strong>Owner</strong>, <strong>Editor,</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Viewer</strong>. &nbsp;See what they mean <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/22831810-Owners-Editors-and-Viewers">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To designate roles for users of a shared folder: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Sign into your account on <strong>www.aerofs.com</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Click on&nbsp;<strong>My Shared Folders</strong> on the left hand panel, then find the folder to which you want to make changes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Click '<strong>Actions</strong>' to the right of the folder name and select '<strong>Manage Members'</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The "Manage Members" option only is available only to "Owners" of the folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. From the manage members&nbsp;window you can view your own <strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Role</strong>, as well as the roles of other users sharing this folder. At the bottom of the window you can also invite new users to this folder and assign roles to them at the time of invite.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="https://support.aerofs.com/attachments/token/iaokihx1ioayrqo/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-10-04+at+10.56.27+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-10-04_at_10.56.27_AM.png" width="509" height="334" /></p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; padding-left: 30px;">5. Click on the <strong>Role</strong> of the person that you want to designate as either <strong>Owner, Editor</strong> or <strong>Viewer</strong> from the drop down menu</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;<img src="https://support.aerofs.com/attachments/token/i0zvmju49apyaoe/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-10-04+at+10.56.53+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-10-04_at_10.56.53_AM.png" width="506" height="333" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. &nbsp;Click the <strong>Close</strong> button when complete. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note&nbsp;that when a member of a shared folder is a <strong>Viewer</strong>, any changes that user makes to a shared folder will NOT be transferred to other users or other devices belonging to the user themselves. &nbsp;Any changes made by a Viewer are available ONLY on the local device where the changes were created.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I find my Computer ID?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Computer ID</strong> uniquely identifies your computer and is useful in troubleshooting syncing problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To find the <strong>Computer ID</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Go to AeroFS icon &gt; Preferences</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="/attachments/token/v6vxxgbichl7ouj/?name=tray+menu.png" alt="tray_menu.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Click on <strong>User ID</strong> and it will change to the <strong>Computer ID</strong><img style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" src="/attachments/token/rdgktmpskczvqfc/?name=user+id.png" alt="user_id.png" width="446" height="540" /></p>

<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I start using AeroFS?</h2>
<p>After successfully installing the AeroFS desktop client, you should now see a folder called "AeroFS" inside your file system.</p>
<p><strong>To start sharing:</strong></p>
<p>Create another folder inside it for whatever it is you wish to share, let's call it "<strong>Vacation Pics</strong>". So now the path to the folder is&nbsp;<strong>.../AeroFS/Vacation Pics.</strong>&nbsp;Now right-click on the folder name "Vacation Pics" and you should see AeroFS in the menu, as shown in our "<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/24111632">How do I share a folder</a>" article.</p>
<p>As you can see, the person you invited to the shared folder will receive an email once you share with them. There will be a link in the email that takes them to aerofs.com, where they can sign in and accept the invitation. Once that's done, wait a few minutes, and they should see a copy of the shared folder appear on their computer, with the same path:&nbsp;<strong>.../AeroFS/Vacation Pics.</strong></p>
<p>Whenever AeroFS is running on both of your computers (and make sure they are on at the same time), any file moved into that folder will be synced to both devices.</p>
<p><strong>Additional features can be found by clicking on the AeroFS icon:</strong></p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Open AeroFS Folder</strong> &ndash; takes you directly to the central &ldquo;AeroFS&rdquo; folder created on your file system</p>
<p><strong>Shared Folders</strong> &ndash; lists all folders you are currently sharing</p>

<p><strong>No active transfers</strong> OR <strong>Downloading&hellip;/Uploading...</strong> &ndash; displays a window called &ldquo;Transfers&rdquo; that lists current transfers between your device and other devices. Keep in mind that many small files may transfer so quickly that they do not appear in the Transfer Window.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How do I share between Team Servers?</h2>
<p>For those who cannot move all the folders you wish to sync under one drive and therefore cannot move everything under the designated "AeroFS" folder, Team Server can be used to sync folders on your file system outside of the "AeroFS" folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To use this feature, you will need to choose the &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aircomputing.zendesk.com/entries/23690567-Choosing-between-local-storage-compressed-storage-and-S3-storage-on-Team-Server">On this computer &gt; Default storage</a></strong>&nbsp;option during Team Server&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aircomputing.zendesk.com/entries/23596201-Set-up-Team-Server-with-local-storage-compressed-storage-or-S3">Setup</a></strong>. &nbsp;Once you've installed and the Team Server icon appears in your task bar, do the following:</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Team Server</strong> icon</p>
<p>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Share Folder...</strong>&nbsp;from the main menu</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/qmwwxfwrhlmcpzc/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-05-03+at+11.38.38+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-05-03_at_11.38.38_AM.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Choose&nbsp;</span><strong>Add...</strong><span>&nbsp;to select a folder from your file system to share.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/519nheuvoqyx5hj/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-06-12+at+10.56.11+PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-06-12_at_10.56.11_PM.png" width="414" height="305" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you do, the folder name should appear on under&nbsp;</span><strong>Shared Folders </strong>panel<span>&nbsp;on the left side of the window. &nbsp;Folders listed here will not have members until you invite someone explicitly to the folder. &nbsp;However, folders listed here will sync with all other Team Servers that is installed using the same admin username. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To sync between Team Servers, on the second, third and each subsequent Team Server installed, also choose the default storage option. &nbsp;Then look for the folders you shared (those listed in the 'Shared Folders' window): .../AeroFS Team Server Storage/shared. &nbsp;You can then move that shared folder -- FOLDER1 in the above example - to anywhere on your file system. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When this is complete, any folder on one of your devices can sync with any folder on another device. &nbsp;As long as AeroFS &nbsp;Team Server is running and connected, syncing will happen. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>How do I share a folder?</h2>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Sharing A Folder With Yourself</span></strong></p>
<p>If you have multiple devices linked to the same AeroFS account, simply drag/drop or copy/paste a folder into your AeroFS folder and it will start to get synced to your other devices. Files moved into the AeroFS folder will also automatically get synced to your other devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 11px;"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Sharing A Folder Using The AeroFS Icon</span></strong></p>

<h2>What are the system requirements to run AeroFS?</h2>
<p class="p1">AeroFS (both the desktop client and Team Server) runs on the following operating systems:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows XP and later</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and later</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ubuntu 10.04 and later</strong>.&nbsp;While we don't officially support other Linux distributions, many users have reported successful installs in addition to Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<p class="p1">AeroFS now ships with its own version of OpenJDK on Windows. This streamlines the installation process and addresses both security concerns around a system-wide installation of Java, as well as compatibility issues when Java requires an update. The version of OpenJDK that is bundled with AeroFS is only accessible to AeroFS, and should not pose any security risk to the rest of your system.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Mac OS X</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Mac OS X users need a processor that supports 64-bit applications. You can check what you have by clicking on the Apple menu -&gt; About this Mac, and looking at the processor. If it's an Intel Core 2 Duo or Xeon, then it should be able to run 64-bit applications. If, on the other hand, it says "Core Duo" or "Core Solo" processor, then you won't be able to run AeroFS.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Similar to Windows, AeroFS ships with its own version of OpenJDK on Mac OS X.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Ubuntu</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We require the following dependencies to be installed on your Ubuntu system: OpenJDK's JRE 6 or 7, GNU coreutils and procps.</p>

<h2>How do I share folders between my Team Server and my Desktop Client?</h2>
<p>As of version 0.4.184, Team Server enables you to share folders outside of the main AeroFS Team Server Storage Folder. &nbsp;To use this, you will need to choose the &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aircomputing.zendesk.com/entries/23690567-Choosing-between-local-storage-compressed-storage-and-S3-storage-on-Team-Server">On this computer &gt; Default storage</a></strong> option at <strong><a href="https://aircomputing.zendesk.com/entries/23596201-Set-up-Team-Server-with-local-storage-compressed-storage-or-S3">Setup</a></strong>. &nbsp;Once you've installed and the Team Server icon appears in your task bar, do the following:</p>
<p>Click on the Team Server icon</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Share Folder...</strong> from the main menu</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/qmwwxfwrhlmcpzc/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-05-03+at+11.38.38+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-05-03_at_11.38.38_AM.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Choose </span><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Add...</strong><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"> to select a folder from your file system to share.&nbsp;</span><img style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" src="/attachments/token/2wzndpkmwd4jrmf/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-05-06+at+5.46.18+PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-05-06_at_5.46.18_PM.png" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Once you do, the folder name should appear on under&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Shared Folders</strong><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;on the left side of the window, and those that are sharing the folder will appear in the Users</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;panel to the right. &nbsp;If you're <strong>adding a new</strong> folder, the corresponding </span><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Members</strong><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"> list will be blank. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Invite Others...</strong><span>&nbsp;to add the email address of anyone you want to share the folder with.

<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Once the person you invited accepts the invitation, their email address will appear in the <strong>Members</strong> panel next time to open up the <strong>Manage Shared Folders</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(</strong>from<strong> AeroFS &gt; Shared Folders...)</strong> window.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;</span><img style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" src="/attachments/token/jgwjn7p9jsluay0/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-05-15+at+10.47.30+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-05-15_at_10.47.30_AM.png" /></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I install the AeroFS Android application?</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Android app is available in the Play Store and supports <strong>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich</strong> and later. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aerofs.android" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aerofs.android</a></p>
<p>A few things to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have the beta version of the app before it was released through the the Play Store, you will have to uninstall it before installing the new app.</li>
<li>The app permits one-way sync. &nbsp;Meaning that it is read-only at the moment, and you cannot update data from your Android phone.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AeroFS uses your SD card internally to cache downloaded files. However,&nbsp;we do not recommend that you access those files directly,&nbsp;as this may causes problems with the app.</li>
</ul>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I unshare or stop sharing a shared folder?</h2>
<p>If you are the&nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><a href="https://aerofs.zendesk.com/entries/23851051-Owner">Owner</a></strong>&nbsp;of a shared folder that was created on an AeroFS desktop client, you have the ability to remove other members of the folder. By removing them, you in effect, stop sharing with them. Removed individuals will still have a copy of said folder on their local drive, in the same state as the last time it synced. However they will no longer receive updates.</p>
<p>To remove a single user from a shared folder:&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the <strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">AeroFS icon</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to AeroFS &gt; Shared Folders &gt; select the folder in question</li>
<li>Select the Members tab, select the person you wish to remove</li>
<li>From the arrow, choose "Remove"</li>
</ol>
<p>From <strong>www.aerofs.com</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in</li>
<li>Choose My AeroFS/Shared Folders on the left panel</li>
<li>Select the folder in question and click Options</li>
<li>Select the member you removed and click Options</li>
<li>Select Remove</li>
</ol>
<p>This prevents all <strong>future</strong> updates from syncing to that person's device and removes the folder. However, <strong>the user will have a copy in their version history folder, which is local to their computer only</strong>.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can also start with a fresh, unshared, folder:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename the folder you shared to a temporary name&nbsp;</li>
<li>Create a new folder with the old name&nbsp;</li>
<li>Move the content of the old folder to the new folder&nbsp;</li>
<li>Delete the old folder. The deletion will transfer to other members and the folder will disappear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Administrators of an AeroFS organization can remove users from the organization, but not from a folder unless they are also the Owner of the folder.</p>
<p>Users cannot be removed from Team Server directly, unless the shared folder was created on Team Server originally (<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23754366-Share-between-Team-Server-and-Desktop-Clients">here's how</a>.)</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Why is there network activity to AeroFS servers? Doesn't AeroFS directly connect my computers?</h2>
<p>AeroFS uses a relay server that helps your devices sync your files when a direct connection cannot be made. This happens typically if there is a firewall or something else preventing the two respective networks from connecting to one another.</p>
<p>If your devices are on the same LAN and you are still seeing activity to some location in the aerofs.com domain, please let us know.</p>
<p>Again, AeroFS servers simply relays information between devices, there is no transparency into the data itself, as we also employ end-to-end encryption between your devices and only your devices.</p>
<p>More information can be found in our&nbsp;<a href="/entries/23728686-What-information-is-stored-on-the-AeroFS-servers-">what is stored on AeroFS servers</a>&nbsp;article.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I disable desktop notifications?</h2>
<p><span>Whenever a change is made to a file in a shared folder, AeroFS will notify you with a pop up display. &nbsp;If you would like to stop receiving these, simply go to AeroFS &gt; Preferences and unselect "Notify me about file changes." &nbsp;You can turn this back on whenever you would like. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I delete old versions of shared/synced files?</h2>
<p><span>In the AeroFS tray menu click on the "Sync History..." entry. From there you can delete specific versions of a file or, if you're more concerned about saving space than conserving history, all versions under a specific folder.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="/attachments/token/eaadmwe4aw9grdl/?name=synchistory.png" alt="synchistory.png" /></span></p>
<p>If you do not delete old versions manually, AeroFS automatically attempts to clean up old versions once a day at 0400 local time. &nbsp;We plan to give finer control over this in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What are the different storage types for the AeroFS Team Server?</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;AeroFS Team Server now comes with three storage options. You will be prompted to choose one during <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23596201">set up</a>. It is very important that you choose the one that suits your needs at this stage.&nbsp;<strong>Once the storage option is chosen at Setup, you&nbsp;will not</strong><strong>&nbsp;be able to change your mind for the duration of the installation.</strong>&nbsp;If you need another type of storage with Team Server, install it fresh on another device, or, Unlink this one from aerofs.com, and reinstall.</p>
<p>First, you will be prompted to choose between <strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">On this computer</strong> and <strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">On Amazon S3.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>On this computer &gt; Preserve folder structure</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This option creates a readable/writable copy of your team's files on the device where you installed Team Server. This allows complete transparency into the data shared by all the users who are part of your organization, and allows admins to designate which folders to share with users FROM the Team Server device.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Specifically, any admin of a Team Server is able to:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Monitor individual folders synced by each Team Member in directory&nbsp;<strong>AeroFS Team Server Storage/users.</strong></li>
<li>Monitor shared folders between Team Members in the directory&nbsp;<strong>AeroFS Team Server/shared.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Designate any folder in the local file system as shared</strong>&nbsp;(not only the AeroFS default folder) by right-clicking on the folder name you wish to share.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div><strong style="line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 12px;">On this computer &gt; Compressed and de-duplicated&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">This is also sometimes referred to as "Block Storage". It is best&nbsp;suited for those who wish to conserver disk space and do not need to transparency into the data synced to Team Server locally. In this scenario, Team Server serves as a peer that bridges the gap when certain users are not available.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">By choosing this option, your data:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Is<strong> De-duplicated and compressed</strong>&nbsp;to save disk space.</li>
<li>Benefits from <strong>increased privacy</strong> - folder and file names are appear as strings of numbers and letters.<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li>Cannot be extracted on the same device. If you need to access your files stored on Team Server, you can install and launch another Team Server using the default storage option, or view the files by launching a client that is sharing the folder.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong style="line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 12px;">On Amazon S3</strong></div>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Data shared by users of the organization is automatically backed up by Amazon S3. With this option, the AeroFS Storage Folder will contain nothing, and admins will not be able to monitor or access users' folders from Team Server.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Important note</strong></em>: AeroFS is only compatible with a bucket created in the <strong>"US Standard"</strong>&nbsp;region.&nbsp;When configuring your S3 bucket, please make sure that&nbsp;the bucket grants List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, and Edit Permissions to the AWS user account that is administering AeroFS Team Server.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>How do I update AeroFS?</h2>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Automatic Updates</span></strong></p>
<p>AeroFS Desktop Client and Team Server automatically check for updates every hour and install the update if it's available. So you don't need to worry about updating AeroFS - we'll do it for you! &nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Manual Updates</strong></span></div>

<h2>How do I add users to my AeroFS Organization?</h2>
<p>Once you've created your AeroFS account on www.aerofs.com, you are by default the administrator of your own organization. &nbsp;You can confirm if you are the team admin by looking for the <strong>My Organization</strong> menu on the left hand panel after signing in:</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/cxuezl2anbsislr/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-12-17+at+5.40.05+PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-12-17_at_5.40.05_PM.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can start to share folders with others at this point, without adding them to your organization. &nbsp;One copy of the shared folder will exist on each of your devices.</p>
<p>Adding someone to your organization is relevant when you want to run Team Server for your organization. &nbsp;Team Server is a central repository for your organization's data. &nbsp;Read more about Team Server <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/24141798-Team-Server">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add users to your organization:</p>

<h2>How Do I Convert My SSL Certificate File To PEM Format?</h2>
<p>Most Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue certificates in PEM format. PEM certificates typically have extensions like&nbsp;<strong>.pem</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.crt</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.cer</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>.key</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PEM format uses the header and footer lines "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and&nbsp;"-----END CERTIFICATE-----" as shown in the image below.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-right wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201224100/Screen_Shot_2014-08-27_at_2.56.56_PM.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Other certificate formats include the DER/Binary, P7B/PKCS#7, and PFX/PKCS#12 formats.&nbsp;The AeroFS Appliance requires a certificate&nbsp;in PEM format in step 9 of the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/201438864">appliance setup</a>. This certificate will be used to ensure secure transactions between your appliance and users' web browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Converting Your Existing Certificate To PEM Format&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If your certificate is not in PEM format, you can convert it to the PEM format using the following OpenSSL commands:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Convert DER to PEM:&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre style="color: #555555; font-size: 13.63636302947998px; background-color: #fafafa;">openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem </pre>

<h2>What is the AeroFS Private Cloud "Device Authorization" Subsystem and how do I configure it?</h2>
<p>The <strong>AeroFS Private Cloud Device Authorization&nbsp;Subsystem</strong> grants IT administrators fine-grained control over which users and devices are permitted to run AeroFS desktop clients. This is accomplished in a flexible way via the <strong>Device Authorization Endpoint </strong>which must be implemented and configured by the IT admin. The endpoint, once configured, will receive a request for authorization from the AeroFS appliance when a user is trying to install AeroFS on a given desktop device. The endpoint must&nbsp;return a boolean true/false indicating whether or not this user should be permitted to complete the installation. If false is returned, the installation is aborted.</p>
<p>This subsystem should not be confused with AeroFS' end-to-end encryption and private certificate authority, which is always enabled and cannot be configured. <a href="https://aerofs.com/security" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>
<h2>Implementing your Device&nbsp;Authorization Endpoint</h2>
<p>Your endpoint must implement a RESTful interface which is defined as follows:</p>
<pre>POST /device/v1.0/user/&lt;string:email&gt;/authorized<br />{<br />    "name": "&lt;hostname&gt;",<br />    // IP Address as seen by the AeroFS Appliance.<br />    "ip": "&lt;ip&gt;",<br />    "os": {<br />        "family": "&lt;os_family&gt;",<br />        "name": "&lt;os_name&gt;"<br />    },<br />    "interfaces" : [<br />        // Includes IP addresses as seen by the device itself.<br />        {"name": "&lt;ifname&gt;",<br />         "ips": ["&lt;ip_0&gt;", "&lt;ip_1&gt;", ... ],<br />         "mac": "&lt;mac&gt;" },<br />        ...<br />    ],<br />    // Future enhancements go here...<br />}</pre>
<p>Note that the body of this POST request is JSON-formatted data which describes the device. As shown, the name of the device, operating system information, and a list of network interfaces and IP addresses are provided.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>POST /device/v1.0/user/matt@acme.com/authorized<br />{<br />    "name": "Matt Windows",<br />    "ip": "192.168.1.100",<br />    "os": {<br />        "family": "Windows",<br />        "name": "Windows XP Pro SP2"<br />    },<br />    "interfaces" : [<br />        {"name": "en0",<br />         "ips": ["192.168.1.100"],<br />         "mac": "01:02:03:04:05:06" },<br />        {"name": "lo0",<br />         "ips": ["127.0.0.1", "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1"],<br />         "mac": "" },<br />    ],<br />}&nbsp;</pre>
<p>This endpoint must return:</p>
<ul>
<li>204 No Content: when the device&nbsp;is authorized</li>
<li>401 Not Authorized: when the device&nbsp;is not authorized</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuring your Device&nbsp;Authorization Endpoint</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Audit Service can be enabled and configured via the Private Cloud Appliance web administration console.</p>

<h2>What are the implications of enabling API access on the AeroFS Private Cloud?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-size: small; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #fafafa;">The AeroFS API is used to download and upload content stored on your devices running AeroFS. The API pulls files from either a team server or devices linked to your AeroFS user ID. It does not pull files from other users' devices, even if they have the files that you are trying to access via the web client or mobile device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>With the AeroFS API access enabled, you can log into your AeroFS&nbsp;<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/26150379-AeroFS-Web-Admin-Panel">Web Admin Panel</a>&nbsp;and click on the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/articles/202877620">My Files</a>&nbsp;link or simply open your mobile app to access your files.</p>
<p>The AeroFS API Access setting is enabled by default for Private Cloud users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AeroFS API Access settings can be changed at any time on the AeroFS Desktop Client by going into&nbsp;<strong>Preferences</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Advanced&nbsp;</strong>and checking or unchecking the&nbsp;<strong>Enable API Access&nbsp;</strong>checkbox, as seen in the screenshot below.</p>
<center><img src="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200452504/Screen_Shot_2014-03-26_at_2.33.13_PM.png" alt="" /></center><center>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you are running AeroFS via Command Line Interface (CLI), use the "config" command to enable or disable API access:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200839510/Screen_Shot_2014-05-30_at_12.19.05_PM.png" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>Things to consider when enabling or disabling AeroFS API Access on the Private Cloud:</p>
<ol>
<li>AeroFS API Access must be enabled to allow authenticated users to access shared files from anywhere using the web client or mobile app.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Even if AeroFS API Access is enabled, no one else outside of your organization can see your data since your AeroFS Appliance resides behind your firewall.</li>

<h2>How do I launch my AeroFS Appliance in Amazon EC2?</h2>
<p>Once you have obtained your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Qcow2">Qcow2</a>&nbsp;formatted AeroFS Appliance, you can launch the system in Amazon EC2 via the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SettingUp_CommandLine.html">EC2 Command Line Interface</a>. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume you have set the following environment variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS_ACCESS_KEY: your AWS access key ID.</li>
<li>AWS_SECRET_KEY: your AWS secret key.</li>
<li>S3_BUCKET_NAME: the name of the Amazon S3 destination bucket for your instance manifest (you will need both read and write access to this bucket).</li>
</ol>
<p>After you have installed and configured the Amazon CLI, run the following commands to launch your AeroFS Appliance as an Amazon EC2 instance:</p>
<pre>gunzip aerofs-appliance.qcow2.gz </pre>
<pre>qemu-img convert -O raw aerofs-appliance.qcow2 aerofs-appliance.raw</pre>
<pre>ec2-import-instance -t m3.xlarge -f RAW -a x86_64 -p Linux -o $AWS_ACCESS_KEY -w $AWS_SECRET_KEY -b $S3_BUCKET_NAME aerofs-appliance.raw&nbsp;</pre>
<p>Note that in the above import instance command the specified size is m3.xlarge. Due to restrictions in the Amazon EC2 CLI, you <strong>must</strong> specify a size of m3.xlarge or higher in order to launch your instance. However, once your instance has been successfully launched, you can adjust its size as you see fit in your EC2 Console. As per our <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/22661589-What-are-the-system-requirements-to-run-the-AeroFS-Private-Cloud-Appliance">AeroFS Appliance system requirements document</a>, the appliance requires a minimum of 1.5 GB RAM; therefore, m1.small is the smallest instance size we officially support.</p>
<p>You may also wish to provide the -g option to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-ImportInstance.html">ec2-import-instance</a> to specify your desired security group, since this cannot be changed once the instance has been launched. Your AWS instance must adhere to our <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/22661589">Appliance Firewall Requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Once the last command has completed, you will be able to see your instance status in your <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">AWS Console</a>. Obtain the public IP Address or Public DNS of your instance, type it into your browser, and follow steps 3-7 in our <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23316905-Set-up-the-AeroFS-Appliance">Appliance setup article</a> to complete your installation.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I configure my AeroFS Private Cloud Audit Service?</h2>
<p>The <strong>AeroFS Audit Service</strong> is part of the Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) feature in the&nbsp;AeroFS Private Cloud. This service allows an AeroFS appliance administrator to capture&nbsp;and analyze AeroFS usage and sharing data for their organization.</p>
<p>The Audit Service is a central point that collects near-real-time information from AeroFS&nbsp;server and client processes, collates them and delivers these events to a downstream system for indexing and archiving. It does not hold a permanent audit log on the AeroFS&nbsp;appliance - we prefer that your existing SIEM and archiving systems own your audit data.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Audit Service can be enabled and configured via the Private Cloud Appliance&nbsp;web administration console. It requires "organization administrator" privilege, similar&nbsp;to other appliance actions - backup, setup, and upgrade.</p>
<h3>Appliance management</h3>
<p>To configure administration, first log in to the Private Cloud Appliance as an administrator. On bottom left, under "My Appliance" click the "Manage" link.</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/xtkutztnhei1wof/?name=Manage+button.png" alt="Manage button.png" width="153" height="255" /></p>
<h3>Auditing Configuration</h3>
<p>On the appliance management page, on the left-hand side, click the Auditing link.This will show the current auditing configuration (default disabled) and allow you to enable and configure auditing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="/attachments/token/41utzhq7qgav5hn/?name=auditing_scrn.png" alt="auditing_scrn.png" width="100%" /></p>
<h2>Downstream systems</h2>
<p>At minimum, configuring a downstream system requires only a host name&nbsp;(or IP address) and a port number. The destination host:port combination must be reachable from the Private Cloud Appliance.</p>
<p>The protocol from the audit server to the downstream system is very simple: JSON documents, one per line. Here are a few sample events as they are delivered from the audit service. After certifying a desktop and mobile client, this user received an invite to a shared folder.</p>
<pre>{"timestamp":"2014-02-21 23:59:52.044","topic":"DEVICE","device_name":"loaf","os_name":"OSX","device_type":"Desktop Client","event":"device.certify","device_id":"af12c4211b3344a3a4fc773c75d316c8","os_family":"OSX","user":"jon@syncfs.com"}<br />{"timestamp":"2014-02-21 23:58:42.110","topic":"DEVICE","device_type":"Mobile App","event":"device.certify","device_id":"Jon's iPad","user":"jon@syncfs.com"}<br />{"folder":"55fc6c17e1fa0c6e81770a4585a064d1","timestamp":"2014-02-22 00:00:18.844","topic":"SHARING","event":"folder.invite","sharer":"doris@syncfs.com","target":"jon@syncfs.com","role":["MANAGE","WRITE"]}</pre>
<p>Any TCP listener can work as a downstream system. If you are using Splunk, for example,&nbsp;it includes a "TCP" input type which is supported for this use. Splunk is able to automatically index the JSONstream.</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/f2zhvowrtguehhr/?name=splunk+audit+example.png" alt="splunk_audit_example.png" width="100%" /></p>
<h3>SSL connections to downstream systems</h3>
<p>In general, the SSL connection is preferred as it prevents eavesdropping on the&nbsp;communication between the AeroFS Private Cloud Appliance and the downstream system.&nbsp;The downstream system must have an SSL-enabled TCP Listener. Again, using Splunk as&nbsp;an example, the "tcp-ssl" input type presents this interface; and it is simple to build<br />any line-based listener that supports this.</p>
<p>AeroFS requires certificate authentication when talking to a destination server. We must&nbsp;validate the certificate is valid and represents the destination host. The destination&nbsp;server may present a certificate that is signed by a known, trusted CA (one of those in&nbsp;the Java default keystore). In most cases, the destination audit server will simply <br />present a self-signed certificate, or one that is signed by an internal CA.</p>
<p>In this case, we allow the AeroFS administrator to explicitly set a trusted certificate&nbsp;for the downstream server. The certificate should be in PEM format - it will look something like</p>
<pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<br />MIIB5zCCAVCgAwIBAgIEUszeGDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADA4MScwJQYDVQQKEx5P<br />cGVuRFMgU2VsZi1TaWduZWQgQ2VydGlmaWNhdGUxDTALBgNVBAMTBGxvYWYwHhcN<br />MdAZPfZRmHOqlX1Zj0vgLcjWKhU5B4tcKqScHX56DlyoiNd7Hgga/1StFWtQT2or<br />-----END CERTIFICATE-----</pre>
<h3>Don't know the self-signed certificate?</h3>
<p>Some unfortunate tools automatically generate a self-signed certificate and don't make&nbsp;that very clear. To find out what certificate a particular service is using, we can&nbsp;use the openssl commandline tool:</p>
<pre>openssl s_client -connect {downstream.server.address}:{PORT}</pre>
<p>The certificate information will be displayed, including the certificate in PEM form which the administration interface expects.</p>
<p>Please verify this certificate is coming from the expected system and not a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
<h2>Finalizing your configuration</h2>
<p>When you click the "Save" button on the auditing page, the AeroFS appliance will restart the identity management service and the audit collection point. This will not interrupt file synchronization.</p>
<p>After you enable the audit service, clients will start sending audit events on their next startup.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What happens if my Private Cloud license expires?</h2>
<p>When the license expires, major functions in the AeroFS Appliance will shut down, such as new user registration and Web functions. In addition, some desktop clients and Team Servers will stop syncing data. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>All user files in desktop clients and Team Servers will remain intact.</li>
<li>All user data in the appliance will be retained.</li>
<li>The admin can manage the appliance at http://<em>host.name:8484</em>&nbsp;where <em>host.name</em> is the hostname of the appliance.</li>
<li>The admin can backup and export the appliance's data via the aforementioned URL.</li>
<li>The admin can upload a new license to the appliance to restore all AeroFS functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your license has expired, please email <a href="mailto:support@aerofs.com">support@aerofs.com</a>&nbsp;to renew it.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What should I do if my appliance boots to a blank screen?</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Appliance is delivered as a 64-bit virtual appliance in the Open Virtual&nbsp;Appliance format. It is currently supported in VMWare, VirtualBox, and OpenStack&nbsp;environments. In most cases, importing and starting the appliance for the first time is just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the host cannot boot the virtual appliance for <em>any </em>reason, the result&nbsp;will usually be the same: a black&nbsp;screen with a blinking cursor, and no progress.</p>
<p>When confronted with a virtualization problem like this, here are the steps we follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The host machine requires a 64-bit Intel x86 CPU, with hardware virtualization instructions (Intel VT-x). It is now quite rare to find a computer without hardware virtualization support - however your BIOS may have this feature disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Boot to your computer's BIOS configuration and look for a setting that may be called "virtualization extensions", "Intel Virtualization Extensions", or something similar.&nbsp;It might be found in a "Processor" or "Chipset" section of the bios. Unfortunately there is no standardization among the BIOS vendors.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">If you're curious, there is a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#hwvirt" target="_blank">short and useful document from VirtualBox</a>&nbsp;with more information on hardware virtualization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are running a recent version of the hypervisor. Support for 64-bit systems was uneven in some older releases, and the virtualization vendors have been actively releasing fixes and performance improvements.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, you should not try to run multiple hypervisors simultaneously on one host machine.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Some VirtualBox users have reported problems running guest OS'es when Hyper-V is active&nbsp;on the same host machine. This is most likely a result of the same VT-x instructions&nbsp;mentioned above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Even if it doesn't prevent booting the guest appliances, &nbsp;one of the environments will have to run in software virtualization mode, which will hurt performance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">To fix this, we simply suggest running the AeroFS Appliance in the same&nbsp;virtualization environment as your existing guests.</p>
<p>If you've checked the above and are still stuck, please get in touch with us! We haven't&nbsp;seen every virtual environment under the sun but we'll be happy to help.</p>

<h2>How do I configure ActiveDirectory and LDAP with my AeroFS Appliance?</h2>
<p>AeroFS can delegate account management to your existing ActiveDirectory or LDAP server. In both cases, the AeroFS Appliance uses LDAP to talk to the account directory.</p>
<p>Account management, including LDAP parameters, is configured in the <a title="The Appliance setup workflow" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23350585" target="_blank">Appliance setup workflow</a>.</p>
<h3>Basic Configuration</h3>
<p>The following values make up the basic LDAP configuration:</p>
<dl><dt>Server Host</dt><dd>The hostname or IP of your account server. This address must be resolvable by the Private Cloud Appliance.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Server Port</dt><dd>The port to connect to. Default LDAP ports are 389 for ldap, and 636 for ldaps.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Base DN</dt><dd>This will be the root of the search tree. Generally you would like to point this at the most specific node in your LDAP store that will include all the users that should have access to AeroFS. If you aren't sure where to point this, see below for some search techniques.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Bind user name</dt><dd>To search for a user's email, AeroFS requires access to an account with the ability to run a search. In almost all cases, this should be an account with limited access that you create especially for the AeroFS Private Cloud Appliance. Don't use an unlimited administrator account here.<br /><br />Usually this is given in LDAP format ("CN=Directory Agent,DC=example,DC=com"), but ActiveDirectory will accept other formats ("\\DOMAIN\Directory Agent") etc.<br /><br />See below for hints on testing this.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Password</dt><dd>The password for the bind account given above.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Security</dt><dd>We strongly recommend you enable StartTLS or SSL. Selecting plaintext will result in a warning, and should be avoided for best network security.</dd></dl>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align: baseline;" src="/attachments/token/warocuznhcmvamo/?name=Basic+LDAP+configuration.png" alt="Basic_LDAP_configuration.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Advanced configuration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Here you can configure specifics of your LDAP schema. Most users will not need to modify this section. See below for some hints on easily testing your deployment.</span></p>
<dl><dt>Search scope</dt><dd>By restricting this search to the immediate children only, or ignoring the base DN, you can prune undesired matches from the LDAP result set. Normally this is set to "Search the object specified by Base DN and its entire subtree".</dd></dl><dl><dt>First name attribute</dt><dd>The attribute that stores the users' first name.<br /><br />Normally this should be "givenName".</dd></dl><dl><dt>Last name attribute</dt><dd>The attribute that stores the users' last name.<br /><br /> Normally this should be "lastName".</dd></dl><dl><dt>Email attribute</dt><dd>The attribute in the user record that holds the primary email address.<br /><br /> This attribute should hold the email&nbsp;address that users will provide to AeroFS as their login information.</dd></dl><dl><dt>User class</dt><dd>The object class that all users should belong to.<br /><br />This should be restrictive enough to disallow accounts that may have been allocated for software packages, devices, etc. This becomes part of the LDAP query in the authentication path.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Distinguished name attribute</dt><dd>The name of the attribute in the returned record that gives the user records' distinguished name. The value of this attribute will be used to test the user credential against the LDAP store.</dd></dl><dl><dt>Server certificate</dt><dd>If you are using TLS or SSL and your LDAP server does not have a publicly-signed certificate, you may need to set certificate information here. The certificate lets the AeroFS Private Cloud Appliance verify that it connected to the intended server and not an impostor.<br /><br />You should provide the certificate in PEM form (Base64-encoded DER). See below for more information on getting this value from the server.</dd></dl>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align: baseline;" src="/attachments/token/x0ete1gl4e8bgma/?name=Advanced+LDAP+configuration.png" alt="Advanced_LDAP_configuration.png" width="600" /></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Testing LDAP connectivity</h2>
<p>Any LDAP utility can be used to test and verify your LDAP connection information. The following examples use `ldapsearch`, freely available for OSX and Linux platforms. On Windows, try the `ldp` tool direct from Microsoft - see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224543" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224543</a></p>
<h3>Basic connection tests</h3>
<p>First, a basic connectivity test. This will validate our values for host, port, bind user name, and bind password.</p>
<p>In the following examples, the bind user name is "CN=Directory Manager"</p>
<p>For LDAP with TLS, our preferred configuration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ldapsearch -ZZ -h ldap.example.com -p 389 -D 'CN=Directory Manager' -W</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For LDAPS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ldapsearch -H ldaps://ldap.example.com:636/ -D 'CN=Directory Manager' -W</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For simple LDAP (last resort, not recommended in production):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ldapsearch -x -h ldap.example.com -p 389 -D 'CN=Directory Manager' -W</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the basic connectivity command succeeds, you can continue. If it fails with authentication error, you should check the permissions and value for the bind DN and the bind password.</p>
<p>If the LDAPS or TLS case fails, you may test the simple LDAP version just to validate the bind information. We strongly recommend you set up a secure LDAP channel using one of the transport-layer security modes.</p>
<p>You may require certificate information to enable TLS / SSL; see the section below.</p>
<h3>Finding the root of the user tree</h3>
<p>In this example, we'll start by looking for everything in "example.com", using TLS;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ldapsearch -ZZ -h ldap.example.com -p 389 -D 'CN=Directory Manager' -W <br /> -z 2 -b 'DC=example,DC=com' mail dn objectclass</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The `-z 2` option just limits to the first 2 responses. The -b provides an LDAP path to a search location. Everything after that are the names of the attributes to return for each located record.</p>
<p>Here are the records returned by an LDAP server in our test environment:<br /> # user.1, People, example.comdn: uid=user.1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=comobjectclass: personobjectclass: inetorgpersonobjectclass: organizationalpersonobjectclass: topmail: user.1@maildomain.net</p>
<blockquote>
<p># user.2, People, example.com<br /> dn: uid=user.2,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com<br />objectclass: person<br />objectclass: inetorgperson<br />objectclass: organizationalperson<br />objectclass: top<br />mail: user.2@maildomain.net</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the results, we see:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">the test users are actually grouped under the node "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" - we will use this value for "Base DN"</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">it looks like "organizationalperson" is a good value for us to use for the "object class" setting.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">by providing attribute names on this command line ("mail dn objectclass") we can validate the rest of the values to supply in the Advanced configuration - "First name attribute", "Email attribute", etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Supplying certificate information</h3>
<p>It is possible that your LDAP server was not configured with a publicy-signed certificate. This may happen if your organization has it's own certificate authority, or if your LDAP server is using a self-signed certificate that you trust.</p>
<p>In this case, the AeroFS Appliance requires explicit configuration of the self-signed certificate. Otherwise TLS and SSL communication with the LDAP server will not be permitted.</p>
<p>The following command extracts the certificate from the server and puts it in the required PEM format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>openssl s_client -connect ldap.example.com:636 &lt; /dev/null</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When inserting the certificate, include the "---- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ----" and "---- END CERTIFICATE ----" lines in the setup configuration.</p>

<h2>How do I change my AeroFS Private Cloud identity management type?</h2>
<p>The <a title="Support doc: account management in the private cloud" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23018319" target="_blank">identity management type </a>is determined in appliance setup. This option can be modified on a running AeroFS Appliance with minimal disruption to your user base. Please see the <a title="Support doc: appliance setup workflow" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23350585" target="_blank">appliance setup workflow support document</a> for more details on reconfiguring a running appliance.</p>
<p>This document describes the policy changes if you change the account type for an appliance with existing users.</p>
<h2>From AeroFS-managed to externally-managed accounts</h2>
<p>If you initially set up your appliance to use local (AeroFS-managed) accounts, and are changing it to use AD or LDAP, your users will experience almost no disruption.</p>
<p>No update is required for registered AeroFS devices - they will continue to sync, update, and share files and folders.</p>
<p>Users will stop using the password they chose when they first signed up for the AeroFS Private Cloud. They should now use their AD or LDAP credentials when signing into the web admin interface, or registering a new device with the AeroFS Private Cloud.</p>
<p>If you have users that have signed up for your AeroFS Private Cloud, but do not have AD or LDAP credentials, they will continue to use the password they chose when they signed up for AeroFS.</p>
<p>If later on you migrate a user to the AD/LDAP domain, the AeroFS Appliance will detect this the next time they sign in - they can start using their AD/LDAP credential immediately.</p>
<h2>From externally-managed to AeroFS-managed</h2>
<p>If for some reason you are moving away from AD or LDAP to manage your accounts, your users will require a simple self-service account update.</p>
<p>No update is required for registered AeroFS devices - they will continue to sync, update, and share files and folders.</p>
<p>The next time a user tries to sign in to the web admin interface, or to register a new device, they will find that their AD/LDAP password no longer works. From the web interface signin page, they can request a password reset email.</p>
<p>Once they click the password-reset link, the user can choose a new password to use with AeroFS. The account will be securely managed onboard the Private Cloud Appliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img style="vertical-align: baseline;" src="/attachments/token/nbfxbnmvkidrolk/?name=Forgot+password.png" alt="Forgot_password.png" width="457" height="341" /></p>
</center>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I manage users in my AeroFS Private Cloud?</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Private Cloud supports two types of account management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">ActiveDirectory or LDAP</strong> - AeroFS can leverage your existing ActiveDirectory or LDAP infrastructure. In this case, members of your organization can use their familiar credentials.</li>
<li><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">AeroFS-managed Accounts</strong> - for simpler out-of-the-box setup, you can let the AeroFS Appliance manage user accounts directly. Most user administration is self-service, but you will need to manually invite your users to the Private Cloud.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>ActiveDirectory or LDAP</h3>
<p>The user invitation and signup process is streamlined if you set up AeroFS to use an AD or LDAP server for user authentication.</p>
<p>Any user with an authorized account in your AD/LDAP domain will be able to use the AeroFS Private Cloud. You will not need to send email invitations to your users - just publish the address of your AeroFS Appliance.</p>
<p>When a user first visits your appliance in a web browser, they can log in with their primary email address and AD or LDAP password. They will then be prompted to download and install an appropriate AeroFS client.</p>
<h3>AeroFS-managed Accounts</h3>
<p>If you don't have, or prefer not to use, an existing directory server, the AeroFS Appliance can manage your users locally.</p>
<p>The signup behavior is different in this case. An administrator will need to explicitly invite the users to the AeroFS Private Cloud. To do this, sign in to the Web admin interface and choose the "Team Members" link on the left.</p>
<p>Users will receive an invitation email that directs them to your AeroFS Appliance. On signup, the user will choose a new password to use with AeroFS.</p>
<p>Account information will be stored securely on the appliance. Users will have the ability to reset their password through the self-service web admin interface if they forget it later.</p>
<h3>Configuring Account Management</h3>
<p>In Step 2 of the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23316905-Setting-up-AeroFS-Private-Deployment-for-the-first-time-using-the-GUI">setup process</a>, you will select the Account Management type that you wish to use for your Private Cloud Appliance.</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align: baseline;" src="/attachments/token/d41g0y0jnnvuzzo/?name=Choosing+Account+Management+Type.png" alt="Choosing_Account_Management_Type.png" width="525" height="194" /></p>
<p>You can reconfigure the Appliance at any time if your account management situation changes. For more information on this, please check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" title="Reconfiguring the AeroFS Private Cloud Appliance" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23350585" target="_blank">Reconfigure the AeroFS Appliance</a></li>
<li><a title="Support doc: changing the account management type" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23544130" target="_blank">Migrate Private Cloud user accounts&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I reconfigure my AeroFS Appliance?</h2>
<p>You can re-run the AeroFS Appliance setup workflow at any time. Doing so will not cause your appliance to delete or reset any existing users, AeroFS devices, or shared folders.</p>
<p>To enter the setup workflow, first log in to the Web admin interface with an Administrator account. In the "My Appliance" category on the left side of the interface, click "Manage".</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/xtkutztnhei1wof/?name=Manage+button.png" alt="Manage_button.png" width="213" height="357" /></p>
<p>You may be asked to verify your administrator credential by supplying a copy of the license file that was used to authorize the appliance.<br /> <br />Once in the appliance-management screen, you can choose "Setup" to enter the appliance setup workflow.</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/i1lpxuedmgykeli/?name=Setup+button.png" alt="Setup_button.png" width="327" height="225" /></p>
<p>The appliance setup workflow will then begin. Each step will be pre-populated with values from your existing configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must go through to the last step of setup and click "Apply and Finish", or changes you made in the setup workflow may not be applied properly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Important!</strong> When in the "Apply and Finish" stage at the final step of the appliance setup workflow, there will be a brief service outage as services are reconfigured. During this time, users will not be able to log in to the Web admin interface, or register new devices. Synchronization between existing devices will continue uninterrupted.</em></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I work with people outside my organization?</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Private Cloud can be used to collaborate with people outside your organization. For example, you may want to share graphics proposals with an external contractor.</p>
<p>If your AeroFS Appliance is configured for ActiveDirectory or LDAP&nbsp;account management, you can invite outside people to join your AeroFS Private Cloud without giving them an ActiveDirectory or LDAP account.</p>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>First, you have to make sure that the AeroFS Appliance is accessible to the outside person. If, like many of our Private Cloud customers, you want to limit access to the appliance to users inside the corporate firewall, this could involve a firewall exception or providing guest VPN access.</p>
<p>Without access to the appliance, they will not be able to authenticate their device, nor will they be able to send and receive updates.</p>
<h3>Invitation</h3>
<p>External collaborators must be invited to your AeroFS Private Cloud organization. Only administrators can send invitations.</p>
<p>Sign in to your Web admin interface, and choose Team Members from the left menu. From here you can send email invitations to external users. The email will include a link to your appliance's Web interface, so anyone who does not have access to the appliance will not be able to sign up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align: baseline;" title="Inviting external users" src="/attachments/token/eexjfvgbkqh0sby/?name=Inviting+external+users.png" alt="Inviting_external_users.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they receive the invite link and sign in, your new user will be directed to download an AeroFS client for their device. Note that this client is configured with security information for your Private Cloud instance - it will not connect to other AeroFS Private Clouds, nor will it connect to the Hybrid Cloud service.</p>
<h3>Shared Folders</h3>
<p>You can invite the external user to new AeroFS shared folders, or to an existing shared folder, just using their email address. See <a title="Shared Folders" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/22831810-Owners-Editors-and-Viewers-of-shared-folders-" target="_blank">more on Shared Folder invitation and permissions</a>.</p>
<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>As an Administrator, you can view and modify the shared folders and devices for your collaborators. You can also revoke access rights for any devices they have registered, or even cause the device to delete its local AeroFS folder.</p>
<p>External users will not be able to invite others to your Private Cloud.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I add users to my AeroFS Private Cloud?</h2>
<p>Once your AeroFS Appliance is&nbsp;<a href="/entries/23316905-Setting-up-AeroFS-Private-Deployment-for-the-first-time-using-the-GUI">installed and running</a>, you will be prompted to create the first user. This person is the first member and an admin by default, and it will probably be you (the person who is setting up the appliance).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/6zpjvrfiuil1axe/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-11-20+at+11.07.15+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-11-20_at_11.07.15_AM.png" width="591" height="358" /></p>
<h3>How to invite users</h3>
<p>After you add the first user, they will need to verify via their email. Once they complete sign up, that user will be able to control and provide oversight for the rest of the organization's users and the organization's data.</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/hzx5yzm6nrput9n/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-11-20+at+11.15.18+AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-11-20_at_11.15.18_AM.png" width="586" height="303" /></p>
<p>This may look very familiar to those who are accustomed to using the AeroFS Hybrid Cloud. To add more users from your organization, navigate to "<strong>Team Members</strong>" and complete the Invite People to Team field. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have chosen to integrate with LDAP or ActiveDirectory, no need to invite your users from your organization here. They will be able to sign into AeroFS directly by going to your appliance's Web interface and start using AeroFS. This is a great time to announce the implementation of AeroFS within your organization, if you haven't done so already.</p>
<h3><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Who can you manage</strong></h3>
<p>Within your Private Cloud, every user connecting to the appliance is part of your organization. This includes both:</p>
<ul>
<li>users who are within your organization&nbsp;- such as those you have authorized using LDAP or AD integration, and most likely users who share an email domain with you, and</li>
<li>users outside of your organization that you want to share with - such as vendors, partners, and clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the organization's admin, you have oversight over everyone including internal or external users you invite.</p>

<h2>Migrate AeroFS Hybrid clients to the Private Cloud</h2>
<p class="entry-title">Each instance of the AeroFS Private Cloud comes with prepackaged AeroFS client applications to <a href="https://www.aerofs.com/product/security-and-control">minimize security trust footprint</a>.&nbsp;If you have previously deployed either AeroFS desktop clients or Team Servers, these applications must be unlinked and then reinstalled from your organization's AeroFS Private Cloud web site.</p>
<p class="entry-title">Once you or your admin has completed setting up AeroFS Private Cloud:</p>
<ol>
<li><a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" href="24070943">Unlink&nbsp;your current AeroFS client</a>.&nbsp;(Right click on the AeroFS icon, click on the Preferences menu.

<h2>How do I set up my AeroFS Appliance?</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">1. You will need the latest AeroFS Appliance OVF image or RAW image, which can be obtained via our&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 11px;" href="https://privatecloud.aerofs.com">Private Cloud Administrative Panel</a><span style="font-size: 11px;">.</span></p>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200834740/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_3.53.24_PM.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>2. Click&nbsp;<strong>Download appliance image</strong>&nbsp;to get the latest OVA image file. Click&nbsp;<strong>Download your latest license file</strong>. You will need this license file later on in the installation process.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What are the system requirements to run the AeroFS Private Cloud Appliance?</h2>
<h3>What is included in the Private Cloud</h3>
<p>The AeroFS Private Cloud is deployed completely behind your own corporate firewall. The AeroFS Private Cloud consists of three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AeroFS Appliance: a virtual machine that provides central administration and certificate authority. The appliance is light-weight.&nbsp;<strong><strong>The files being shared via AeroFS are not stored on the appliance</strong></strong>&nbsp;(see <a href="/entries/24141798-Team-Server">Team Server</a> for this functionality).<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></li>
<li>The AeroFS desktop &amp; mobile clients: the client provides peer-to-peer data syncing even if the appliance is unavailable.</li>
<li>The <a href="/entries/24141798-Team-Server">Team Server</a>: This is an optional components, acting as a "super peer." it provides a central syncing location for all the users in your organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>Deploying AeroFS Private Cloud requires that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The virtual machine that will run the AeroFS Appliance must have&nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">8 GB of free disk space, 1.5 GB of RAM, 64-bit CPU core(s).&nbsp;</strong>The following virtualization platforms are officially supported:</li>
<ul>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMWare</li>
<li>Openstack</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 (<a href="/entries/26208024-How-do-I-launch-my-AeroFS-Appliance-in-Amazon-EC2-">How to launch AeroFS Appliance in EC2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<li>Your organization has business-grade Internet. Residential internet providers can sometimes interfere with email delivery from inside the AeroFS Appliance.</li>
<li>You have access to your company&rsquo;s DNS configuration.</li>
<li>Your corporate firewalls / VPN should be configured so that AeroFS desktop clients and Team Servers can access the AeroFS Appliance via the following ports:</li>
<ul>
<li>TCP ports: &nbsp;80, 443, 4433, 5222, 8084, 8484, 8888, and 29438;</li>
<li>UDP port: &nbsp;3478.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Note that each AeroFS Appliance comes with custom-packaged AeroFS client installers to minimize the security trust footprint. If your users have already installed AeroFS applications for AeroFS Hybrid Cloud, they will need to reinstall their AeroFS applications.</p>
<p>Ready to <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" href="/hc/en-us/articles/201438864-How-do-I-set-up-my-AeroFS-Appliance-">set up your AeroFS Appliance</a>?</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I change my AeroFS Appliance hostname?</h2>
<p>During initial setup of your AeroFS Appliance, you were asked to enter a hostname. This is the URL that all your users will sign into to accept invitations, manage devices and access other parts of their AeroFS account. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/8zopiwumv0bmaig/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-11-19+at+12.35.49+PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-19 at 12.35.49 PM.png" width="603" height="375" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest that you avoid changing the hostname unless absolutely necessary. If and when you do need to change it, keep the DNS entry of the old name, and point it to the new instance. Otherwise, AeroFS desktop applications your users run will not be able to contact the appliance to perform administrative functions and auto updates, and AeroFS mobile apps will no longer receive data until the user signs off and signs in the mobile app again.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How can I get in touch with AeroFS support staff?</h2>
<p>The best way to contact us is to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/anonymous_requests/new">submit a ticket online</a>, or reach out to us&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@aerofs.com">over email</a>.</p>
<p>We have dedicated phone support available 7:30am-6pm PST except weekends and publicly observed holidays. Call us today at&nbsp;1-800-656-AERO (1-800-656-2376).</p>
<p>You can also choose to get in touch with us over Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/aerofs">@aerofs</a>).</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>User experience data collection for the AeroFS Appliance</h2>
<p>As a trial user of the AeroFS Private Cloud, you may choose to allow AeroFS to collect data about your experience with the initial setup of your AeroFS appliance. This data allows us to improve the overall installation process of the AeroFS Private Cloud, and is a completely optional step.</p>
<p>AeroFS does not collect data without your consent. Specifically, your AeroFS Appliance sends user experience data <strong>only if</strong> all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The appliance uses a <strong>trial license</strong> as opposed to a paid license.</li>
<li>It is the first time the appliance is configured, as opposed to subsequent installations.</li>
<li>You allow AeroFS to collect the data on the first Web page of the appliance configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all these conditions are true, your&nbsp;appliance will sends AeroFS the following data. Note that this is an <strong>accurate</strong> list of data we collect. We do not collect more than what are described here:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;We only track the following events.</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">A setup page is visited. On this event, the appliance sends a string "Visited Page N" where N is the page number.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">The "Apply and Finish" button is clicked.&nbsp;On this event, the appliance sends&nbsp;a string "Clicked Apply button."</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">The apply process completes successfully.&nbsp;On these events, the appliance sends a string "Completed Setup."</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">An error happened during the setup.&nbsp;On this event, the appliance sends&nbsp;a string "Error on Page N" where N is the page number. Note that the appliance does <strong>not</strong> send any additional information, especially the actual error message.</span></li>
</ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">Along with each event, the appliance additionally sends:</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">The customer ID embedded in your license, which is a randomly assigned integer.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">The version of your AeroFS Appliance.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">The browser type (Chrome, IE, etc) and OS (Mac OS X, Windows, etc) that is used set up the appliance. This helps us debug browser related issues.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">The URL of the page on which the event is sent.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 17.390625px;">Sending data to AeroFS naturally reveals via TCP/IP the public IP address of the computer where your browser runs.</span></li>
</ol></ul>

<h2>AeroFS Web Admin Panel</h2>
<p>The AeroFS Web Admin Panel for Hybrid Cloud is available at <a href="https://aerofs.com/login">aerofs.com</a>. For our Private Cloud users, the location will vary depending on how you <a href="/entries/23316905">set up your system</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201093430/Screen_Shot_2014-07-31_at_11.14.31_AM.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The AeroFS Web Admin Panel is a centralized web application that allows you to:</p>
<ol>
<li>View and manage your shared folders and shared folder invitations</li>
<li>Download the AeroFS Desktop Client application</li>
<li><a href="/entries/24070943">Unlink or Erase</a> your current AeroFS installations</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Additionally, if you are an <strong>AeroFS Organization Administrator</strong>, you can also:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add or remove users in your organization</li>
<li>View and manages shared folders belonging to users in your organization</li>
<li>Download the AeroFS Team Server application</li>
<li>Adjust your AeroFS Organization settings</li>
</ol>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Owners, Editors and Viewers</h2>
<p>AeroFS has three&nbsp;roles when sharing folders with others: <strong>Owner, Editor </strong>and<strong> Viewer</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong>&nbsp;This is the role that has the highest level permissions, and is usually the person who created the shared folder. As the owner, the person can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite new users to the folder</li>
<li>Change any user's role in that folder (here's <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/22331039-Designate-roles-to-members-of-a-shared-folder">how</a>)</li>
<li>Make changes to the contents of the shared folder (download and upload files to and from the folder)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Editor:</strong>&nbsp;This person was invited by the Owner of the shared folder and is able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to the contents of the shared folder&nbsp;(download and upload files to and from the folder)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Viewer:</strong>&nbsp;This person was invited by the Owner of the shared folder and has the lowest access level. &nbsp;Viewers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download files made by other users in shared folders</li>
</ul>
<p>** Any updates made to a file by a Viewer is visible to the Viewer only; the updates will NOT transfer to other users of the shared folder and will NOT transfer to other devices owned by the same Viewer. &nbsp;This role is recommended when you want to distribute files to clients or to partners outside of your team, but do not wish for them to modify the files in any way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of how a Viewer role interacts with Editors (or Owners) in a shared folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>An Editor updates a file in a shared folder, creating version 2 of said file, which is then transferred to all users of the shared folder.</li>
<li>A Viewer of that folder receives version 2 of the file, and updates the file with another set of changes. &nbsp;The Viewer has created version 3 on their local device, which is visible ONLY to this viewer on this device.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Editor makes another update to the same file, creating a second version 3 on the Editor's device. &nbsp;This version 3 is transferred to all other users of the team. &nbsp;</li>
<li>At this point there are two version-3's on the Viewer's device - one created by the Viewer themselves, one downloaded from the Editor. &nbsp;AeroFS notifies the Viewer of the conflict, and the Viewer chooses which version to keep.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the conflict is not resolved on the Viewer's device at that point, and if that Viewer becomes an Editor in the future, the two version-3's will appear on the devices of all other users of the folder. &nbsp;Another user must resolve the conflict at that point.</li>

<h2>Team Server</h2>
<p>The<strong> AeroFS Team Server</strong> is a software package to be installed on regular computers&nbsp;running Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X. It is a central repository for your organization&rsquo;s files. All files and subfolders under each users' AeroFS folder are synced to the server. While the AeroFS client application syncs files directly between users&nbsp;(independently from&nbsp;Team Servers), computers running Team Server can:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Act as a central file relay, so that two client applications do not have to be&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">online at the same time to sync files.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Back up your organization&rsquo;s files in case of device loss or other disasters.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Save sync history in a central location for recovery or auditing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Provide a central access point for AeroFS files, through a traditional protocol&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">like Windows File Share, FTP, and NFS.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Team Server is highly available</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional file servers, Team Server is inexpensive to maintain. Since client applications do not rely on the server,&nbsp;you can run a Team Server on low-cost computers and networks with little impact&nbsp;on overall sync performance. Other users will observe little to zero&nbsp;downtime even if the Team Server is down!</p>
<p><strong>Team Server is low cost</strong></p>
<p>As more users (and thus more devices) share the same dataset, the likelihood of a file being available online from devices other than the Team Server increases dramatically. As a result, as your organization's collaboration demands grow, the requirements on the Team Server's availability and performance remain low. This behavior is in sharp contrast with traditional models where servers are often a bottleneck for the system.</p>
<p><strong>Team Server is easy to setup</strong></p>
<p>Non-technical admins can install Team Servers in under a minute. No public IPs, port forwarding, or bash scripting is needed. After installation, admins can manage Team Servers centrally at aerofs.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Team Server makes recovery easy</strong></p>
<p>You can install multiple Team Servers for mutual backup and disaster recovery. New servers will synchronize data with other servers and client applications in the same organization. Each server replicates the full data set. Therefore, you can take down any one of the Team Servers and when back online again, it will automatically sync up.</p>
<p><strong>Creating an AeroFS organization lets you manage users' and shared data</strong></p>
<p>Team admins can manage the organization&rsquo;s account any time from the <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/26150379">AeroFS Web Admin Panel</a>. These functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Manage users in your organization</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Manage permissions of folders shared by users</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">View, rename, unlink, and erase users' devices</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Manage Team Servers</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent company data from being leaked, if a device is lost or an employee leaves the company, admins can remotely unlink the devices and erase AeroFS files from these devices.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Unlink and Erase</h2>
<p><strong>Unlink</strong></p>
<p>Unlinking a device disables syncing and sharing of your data on that device; it is used to reinstall AeroFS when necessary. After Unlink, the device will no longer stay in sync, but&nbsp;<strong>will</strong>&nbsp;keep files it currently has.</p>
<p>You can Unlink the device that you are using from AeroFS icon &gt; Preferences &gt; Unlink This Computer or you can Unlink any device from any other device via the <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/26150379">AeroFS Web Admin Panel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Erase</strong></p>
<p>Similar to unlinking, erasing your devices can be accomplished via the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/26150379">AeroFS Web Admin Panel</a>. When you apply the erase operation on a device, not only will syncing stop on that device, but all files and folders under the AeroFS root folder will be deleted.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Owner</h2>
<p>When you share a folder with others, you are the Owner of the folder. &nbsp;Owners can:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Invite others to a folder</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Remove anyone from a shared folder</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Promote any member to Owner</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Sync History</h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What is Sync History?</strong></span></p>
<p>AeroFS automatically saves a local copy of a file every time it receives an updated copy of that file from a peer. This is true whether you receive a file update from one of your own devices, or one from another user in a shared folder.</p>
<p>We call this Sync History, and it provides a simple protection plan against mistakes.</p>
<p>Suppose you delete a file on your laptop. AeroFS will synchronize that change - in other words, delete that file on all your devices. If the deletion was accidental, you will probably not be happy about this synchronization.</p>
<p>The same is true if something bad happened to the contents of a file (say you replaced the text of your thesis with a long string of "All work and no play...")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What Sync History Is Not</strong></span></p>
<p>Sync History only makes local copies when peers copy to each other, and we will automatically prune old copies (or prune newer copies to save space). It is not meant as a substitute for version control systems. And you should be aware that local changes will never be copied into Sync History if they are not synced to a peer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Where is Sync History</strong></span></p>
<p>The Sync History dialog is accessible through your AeroFS client - click on the AeroFS icon in the taskbar to bring up the menu and select "Sync History..."</p>
<p>From there you can look at old versions and clean up old copies or "promote" the old versions to replace the current copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Disabling sync history</strong></span></p>
<p>The AeroFS Preferences pane lets you disable sync history on an individual device.</p>
<p>Given the description above, why would anyone want this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people have existing backup software for the files that AeroFS is syncing.</li>
<li>Some people have huge data files, and the cost of keeping old copies around for those is just too high.</li>
<li>Some people use AeroFS on devices with very little local storage, and want to disable Sync History only on those devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you might have a good reason to disable Sync History, but please take care.</p>
<p>By the way, if you disable Sync History it will not affect how we handle conflicts on your files! Any conflict will still be saved and you will get a choice of how to resolve it.</p>

<h2>How Do I Set Up Two-Factor Authentication?</h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium" style="color: #666666; font-size: 15px; font-family: helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif;">Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security for your AeroFS account. With two-factor authentication set up, a malicious person will need to acquire an additional piece of information, that is obtainable only from the two-factor authentication application installed on your mobile device, before they can access your account. You can set up two-factor authentication for your AeroFS account as follows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium" style="color: #666666; font-size: 15px; font-family: helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif;">1.

<h2>What Files Are Not Synced By AeroFS?</h2>
<p>There are certain files that AeroFS will not&nbsp;sync due to cross-platform incompatibilities between Operating Systems (i.e. Windows, Mac, Linux). The following is a list of file types and file names that are not supported by AeroFS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small system files:</p>
<ul>
<li>thumbs.db</li>
<li>icon\r</li>
<li>.ds_store</li>
<li>desktop.ini</li>
<li>~*.tmp</li>
<li>*.attr</li>
</ul>
<p>Temporary files:</p>
<ul>
<li>starts with a tilde and dollar sign (~$)</li>
<li>starts with a period and a tilde (.~)</li>
<li>starts with a tilde and ends with .tmp (~*.tmp)</li>
<li>starts with a period and ends with .kate-swp (.*.kate-swp)</li>
<li>starts with&nbsp;.goutputstream-</li>
<li>starts with .aerofs</li>
</ul>
<p>Filenames containing Windows reserved characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>forward slash (/)</li>
<li>backslash (\)</li>
<li>vertical bar or pipe (|)</li>
<li>question mark (?)&nbsp;</li>
<li>asterisk (*)</li>
<li>less than (&lt;)</li>
<li>greater than (&gt;)</li>
<li>colon (:)</li>
<li>double quote (")</li>
</ul>
<p>Files that can be synced but with limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files/folders that begin with a period (i.e. ".share.doc" or "..sharedfolder") can be successfully synced, however on Mac and Linux these files/folders will be interpreted as system files, so the files will appear as hidden files. The best way to avoid this is by getting rid of the period(s) at the beginning of the file or folder name.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Files such as Windows shortcuts or Mac aliases will only work on operating systems in which they were created. As such, it is best to avoid syncing them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Files with extended file attributes that are stored on a FAT32 drive are not supported. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What should I do if I see "AeroFSFinderExtention is in use" while installing?</h2>
<p>If you are reinstalling AeroFS on your Mac OS X machine and you see an error message similar to "AeroFSFinderExtention is in use", the solution is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the "Terminal" application using spotlight.</li>
<li>Type the command "killall Finder" and press enter.<br /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: killing Finder will stop the existing AeroFSFinderExtension on your system. The finder extension will be restarted after you have completed reinstalling AeroFS. Killing Finder will also close any open Finder windows and will abort existing file copies or moves. The operating system will automatically restart Finder after it has been killed.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Finish reinstalling AeroFS by copying the AeroFS app to your /Applications folder. Restart AeroFS by double clicking /Applications/AeroFS.app or by running AeroFS via spotlight.</li>
</ol>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Why am I being asked to recertify my AeroFS device?</h2>
<p>Each time you authorize a new device, AeroFS generates a secure private certificate.&nbsp;The certificate is used by your AeroFS software to create&nbsp;secure channels for file sync and share between your devices. It is also used by the AeroFS identity service to ensure that only you can access your files.</p>
<p>Certificates are issued with an explicit end date, which is one year from the date of issue. Normally, AeroFS will&nbsp;automatically refresh your device before the current certificate expires.&nbsp;In some very unusual cases, your device may be unable to recertify&nbsp;automatically before the existing certificate expires. In these cases, the device will ask you to explicitly sign in.</p>
<p>If this does happen, you should not be asked to reauthorize that device for approximately one year.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do I install the AeroFS Desktop Client or Team Server on a headless device? </h2>

<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Does AeroFS work with TrueCrypt?</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt">TrueCrypt</a> provides a virtual encrypted disk where files can be stored. TrueCrypt does so by encrypting and storing the content of your files on a single container file.</p>
<p>AeroFS can sync TrueCrypt container files, but there are couple caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>TrueCrypt, by default, enables a security setting where the last modified timestamp and the i-node number of the container file isn't updated when the content of the file is updated. This means that AeroFS won't be able to detect changes in the container file and won't sync the changes to other devices. To prevent this, please disable the setting "Preserve modification timestamp of file containers".</li>
<li>TrueCrypt stores all the file content in a single large container file. Even though AeroFS can sync the container files, AeroFS will re-sync the entire container file whenever the content changes, which could be slow if the container file is big or if the changes are frequent.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, AeroFS works with TrueCrypt, but it may not be particularly efficient<strong>&nbsp;</strong>depending on your usage pattern.</p>

<p>The AeroFS Team Server can be configured to use the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as a backing store. The Team Server will encrypt, compress, and de-duplicate files stored on S3.</p>
<p>At this time,&nbsp;AeroFS can only use a bucket created in the "US Standard" region. &nbsp;We are in the process of making AeroFS compatible with buckets created in other regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To configure Amazon S3 before setting up the Team Server:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="color: #158ec2;" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html">Visit Amazon and sign up for S3</a>.</li>
<li><a style="color: #158ec2;" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_SettingUpUser.html" target="_blank">Create an IAM User</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Keep the&nbsp;IAM User's access key and secret key in safe place. You will need it for the Team Server installation.&nbsp;</li>

<h2>What should I do if the AeroFS Desktop Client doesn't start?</h2>
<div>
<p>If you are experiencing&nbsp;an&nbsp;issue where AeroFS won't start, then it's likely that the data files used by&nbsp;AeroFS have become corrupted.</p>
<p class="im">To fix this, you will have to delete these data files.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="im">These file are stored&nbsp;in the locations listed below; simply delete the folder and relaunch AeroFS:</p>
</div>
<div><strong>On Mac OS X:</strong></div>
<div>AeroFS: ~/Library/Application Support/AeroFS</div>
<div>AeroFS Team Server: ~/Library/Application Support/AeroFSTeamServer</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>On Linux:</strong></div>
<div>AeroFS: ~/.aerofs</div>
<div>AeroFS Team Server: ~/.aerofsts</div>

<h2>How can I handle unsyncable files?</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>What are unsyncable files?</strong></p>
<p>Due to some incompatibilities between various operating systems and file systems, AeroFS will not always be able to save the file to disk even though the file is synced; the file lives in a limbo state where you, as the user, cannot access it.</p>
<p><strong>How to handle unsyncable files?</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, the majority of these incompatibilities are easy to solve by simply renaming the file on the computer where you see the error. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. A notification appears in the tray menu:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" src="https://aerofs.zendesk.com/attachments/token/mji9g8pt07enyvl/?name=nro+notification.png" alt="nro_notification.png" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Click on the menu item, which will open a dialog showing you a list of files that cannot be synced along with the reason in the column called Detail. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" src="https://aerofs.zendesk.com/attachments/token/efq4xdth7ymbchc/?name=nro+dialogue.png" alt="nro_dialogue.png" width="600px" /></p>
<p>3. Resolve each file listed based on the reason provided, and the file should show up on your disk immediately. &nbsp;Below are a list of reasons that you may see and how to resolve them:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.45em;">"Conflicts with &lt;filename&gt;"</strong><br />AeroFS has found two filenames that only differ by case. For example, "Hello" and "hello" on Linux are two different&nbsp;files, and on Windows and OSX, it's the same&nbsp;file. This wreaks havoc on syncing and we recommend that you rename the file.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.45em;">"Filename too long"</strong><br />All&nbsp;file&nbsp;systems has a limit on how long a filename can be. &nbsp;Please shorten the filename to resolve the issue.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.45em;">"Forbidden characters"</strong><br />A filename is not valid if it contains certain characters. OSX and Linux accepts just about anything, Windows doesn't like a long list of characters (found <a style="line-height: 1.45em;" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/22512274-My-Mac-and-PC-aren-t-syncing-with-one-another-what-can-I-do-">here</a>). &nbsp;Renaming the file will resolve the issue.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.45em;">"Reserved filenames"</strong><br />Windows disallows certain filenames for legacy support reasons, here are the details:<br /><a style="line-height: 1.45em;" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx</a>. &nbsp;You can also resolve this by renaming the file.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.45em;">"Non-NFC characters"</strong></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Mac OS X does not play well with filenames containing accented / non-NFC characters.

<p>A file conflict occurs when the same file is modified on two or more computers before the changes are synced. When this happens, AeroFS does not know which version of the file to retain and sync with other computers. As a result, you must specify which version of the file should be retained. There are two ways to view and manage conflicts:</p>
<p>1. Clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>AeroFS icon&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>A conflict was found&nbsp;</strong>will allow you to view and manage file conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><img src="https://support.aerofs.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200526220/Screen_Shot_2014-03-31_at_6.51.16_PM.png" alt="" />&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Conflicted files can also be identified by the&nbsp;yellow fork icon superimposed onto the file's thumbnail.&nbsp;<strong>Right-clicking</strong>&nbsp;on the file &gt;&nbsp;<strong>AeroFS</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Resolve Conflict...&nbsp;</strong>will allow you to view and manage the file conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Can I be the admin of more than one organization?</h2>
<p>Each user can only belong to one organization at a time. &nbsp;Admins are no exception - you can only be the admin of one team. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, an organization can have multiple admins. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To find out if you are the admin of an organization, sign in to aerofs.com, find My Organization &gt; Users on the left panel, and see if there is an "admin" badge next to the user "me." &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Can I have more than one instance of AeroFS on my device?</h2>
<p>The <strong>AeroFS Desktop Client </strong>does not support having two instances running on the same computer at the same time.</p>
<p>If you would like to completely switch from one user account to another, you must first unlink your existing AeroFS installation using the&nbsp;<strong>Preferences</strong> menu and then reinstall using your second account. Your data will remain on your device after you unlink.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">It is possible to have </span><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">AeroFS Team Server and AeroFS client</strong><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"> run together on the came device. Just make sure that you have enough disk space to store all the data if you choose to store Team Server data locally.</span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Is my data inside the AeroFS/AeroFS Team Server folder encrypted?</h2>
<p>The local AeroFS folder created by the <strong>AeroFS Desktop Client</strong> does not&nbsp;encrypt the data at rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When <strong>AeroFS Team Server</strong>&nbsp;is integrated with Amazon S3, your data is encrypted before being transmitted to your S3 bucket.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>AeroFS Team Server</strong> offers two other ways to store data, m<span style="line-height: 17.390625px;" data-mce-mark="1">ore about these options here:&nbsp;https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23690567-Choose-between-local-storage-compressed-storage-and-S3-storage-on-Team-Server</span></p>

<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Does AeroFS run as a service? </h2>
<p>No, AeroFS does not run as a service.</p>
<p>In other words, you must be logged in as a user on your device to be able to use AeroFS. It will not run in the background if you are logged out.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Can I use AeroFS when my computer is disconnected from the Internet?</h2>
<p>Core AeroFS functions, such as syncing files, managing conflicts, showing recent activities, and&nbsp;restoring files from Sync History, can perform in an isolated LAN without Internet access. However, Internet is necessary to access some AeroFS features such as registering new devices, managing shared folders, and central management at aerofs.com.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Can I create a symlink/shortcuts to or from AeroFS?</h2>
<p>Symbolic links&nbsp;(symlinks/soft links<span>) and shortcuts CAN be created from outside to AeroFS pointing to something inside AeroFS. Keep in mind that if the file inside AeroFS is renamed, the link will be broken. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Symlinks/shortcuts from inside the AeroFS to something outside AeroFS, or to another location inside AeroFS, is NOT supported. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>My Mac and PC aren't syncing with one another, what can I do?</h2>
<p>More often than not, syncing issues between Windows and OSX are caused by invalid file and folder names. &nbsp;There are a number of characters allowed by OSX that are not allowed by Windows, and most common of which are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some other differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><strong>Case sensitivity:</strong> some Linux and OSX file systems make a distinction between upper and lower case letters, treating "A" differently from "a", while Windows is case insensitive and sees both as the same. &nbsp;For example, if there are two files "document" and "Document" in the same folder, this is acceptable and will appear as such on OSX and some Linux devices, however Windows does not accept it, so neither files will sync to the Windows device. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><strong>Trailing spaces</strong>: OSX allows trailing spaces but Windows does not. &nbsp;For example, a file called "document_" is acceptable on OSX, but will not sync to Windows. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When you encounter syncing issues between a Mac and PC, the first thing to try is to rename the file or folder to English-only characters on one device and see if that solves the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please contact support@aerofs.com. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>How do I diagnose network problems?</h2>
<p>The most common cause of sync problems are network issues, and we've added a diagnostics tool so you can identify and solve these issues whenever possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To access network diagnostics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Go to the AeroFS icon &gt; Preferences</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="/attachments/token/5buf2eawbbixqvg/?name=tray+menu.png" alt="tray_menu.png" width="265" height="269" /></p>
<p><img style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" src="/attachments/token/0l73vxwnkzhjctm/?name=pref+dialog.png" alt="pref_dialog.png" width="411" height="498" /></p>
<p>2. Click on Network Diagnostics. &nbsp;Here's what you should see:</p>
<p><img src="/attachments/token/if443ln7ndchay6/?name=LAN.png" alt="LAN.png" width="666" height="499" /></p>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">left</strong>, the dialog lists the 3 networks AeroFS uses to sync and how many other computers are on each network.</li>
<li>On the <strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">right,</strong> the dialog lists the details of each of the networks and the associated computers.</li>
<li>Notice that instead of the computer name, the Device ID is listed. &nbsp;This is how AeroFS identifies your computer on the network, and here is <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/25449638-How-do-I-find-my-Device-ID-">how to find your Device ID</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mobile devices are not included here, even though they may be connected as well. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to sync, AeroFS needs to be able to find other computers that are also running AeroFS. The networks used by AeroFS are to find other devices are:</p>
<p><strong>LAN &nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>AeroFS uses this network to sync files with other computers on the same LAN. &nbsp;AeroFS uses<strong> I</strong><strong>P multicast</strong>&nbsp;to discover other computers running AeroFS. These computers establish direct connections over LAN to sync.&nbsp;The dialog shows what port AeroFS is listening on for incoming connections.</p>
<p><strong>WAN</strong> -&nbsp;AeroFS uses this network to sync files with other computers outside of the LAN. &nbsp;A presence server is used to discover other computers. &nbsp;If and only if the presence server is not available, then AeroFS will find 0 reachable computers and will be unable to sync using this method. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Relay&nbsp;</strong>- AeroFS uses this network to sync files when direct connection is impossible due to network configurations such as firewall. &nbsp;Data is&nbsp;encrypted on the sender and then sent to the relay, the relay routes the data to the recipient, and then the recipient decrypts the data so the communication&nbsp;is private and secure. &nbsp;More about AeroFS relay servers <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;" href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23715382-What-is-the-activity-to-AeroFS-servers-Doesn-t-AeroFS-directly-connect-my-computers-">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to a WAN connection, if the presence server is not available, then AeroFS will find 0 reachable computers and will be unable to sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How do I change my password?</h2>
<p>Passwords can be reset using the same process as password recovery:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Go to your AeroFS <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/201439434">Web Admin Panel</a>.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Click on "Forgot your password?" underneath the Sign In button. This will send you an email with a password reset token link.</span></li>
<li>Click on the link in your email and select your new password.</li>
</ol>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Can I install AeroFS on Windows without admin privileges?</h2>
<p>On Windows, the AeroFS installer will ask to run with Administrator privileges. If you do not want or cannot give admin privileges to the installer, you may still proceed with installation, however, some features will be disabled:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Icon overlays in Windows Explorer will be disabled.</li>
<li>Windows Firewall will not be configured to allow traffic to and from aerofsd.exe. As a result, if you do not configure the firewall manually, AeroFS may be unable to sync.</li>
</ol>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>I have two operating systems on the same machine, will AeroFS sync between the two?</h2>
<p>Two installations of AeroFS on the same machine is <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;supported. In other words, if you have Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS on the same machine, you cannot have two separate instances of AeroFS, one running within each operating system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The databases will get very confused, and more importantly, as the two OS are never on at the same time, the two instances of AeroFS cannot be on at the same time, so files between the two installations will never fully sync.</p>
<p>To ensure that your machine successfully syncs with other devices using AeroFS, we recommend that you install AeroFS on one and only one OS of your choosing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have inadvertently installed multiple AeroFS on multiple operating systems on the same device already, please <a href="https://support.aerofs.com/entries/23731793-How-do-I-uninstall-remove-AeroFS-from-my-computer-">Unlink</a> all of them and reinstall.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Which folders can be shared using the desktop client?</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When using the AeroFS desktop client, a centralized folder called "AeroFS" is automatically created on your file system. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Any folder <span style="font-family: Arial;">inside the AeroFS folder</span> can be shared. &nbsp;Some examples are:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">.../AeroFS/Project1</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">.../AeroFS/Documents/Project1 <em>(if "Documents" is not a shared folder)</em></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">.../AeroFS/Manhattan/Documents/Project1 <em>(if "Manhattan" and "Documents" are not shared folders)</em></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Any subfolder created within a shared folder will automatically inherit the same sharing properties - this means everyone who is a member of the shared folder has access to the subfolders within. &nbsp;In the above examples, if .../AeroFS/Documents is shared folder, .../AeroFS/Documents/Project1 cannot be shared again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">To check who has rights to a folder before you share it, visit www.aerofs.com, choose <strong>Shared Folders</strong> from the left hand column, then choose the folder that you would like to view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img src="/attachments/token/qfi9dkzzdlvoyao/?name=Screen+Shot+2013-06-12+at+3.35.18+PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-06-12_at_3.35.18_PM.png" width="435" height="147" /></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How do mirroring devices exchange initial public keys?</h2>
<p>All AeroFS device public keys are signed by the AeroFS root certificate authority at setup time when you enter your username and password. The AeroFS software ships with a copy of the AeroFS root certificate, so it can verify that the cert it receives is signed by the appropriate CA, and that other certs that clients present to it are similarly signed.</p>
<p>So when the mirroring devices try to connect to each other, they verify that the certificate presented by the other device is signed by the root certificate, which was part of the package that you installed initially.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How much Sync history is saved on Team Server?</h2>
<p>When you choose the default storage option - where folders and files are visible - all versions of files that Team Server is able to learn about are stored indefinitely. &nbsp;In other words, you will be able to find every file that has synced at least once with Team Server. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sync History folder is 'pruned' periodically by AeroFS when it detects that your disk space is running low.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Can multiple users on the same Windows computer share one AeroFS?</h2>
<p>No. Currently AeroFS supports one account per device when using the desktop client. &nbsp;If user 'administrator' downloads and installs AeroFS, that adminitrator account should be logged in at all times in order for AeroFS to sync between that computer and another one. &nbsp;Other users accounts on the same Windows computer will not be able to access the AeroFS folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Can I run the AeroFS Desktop Client and the AeroFS Team Server on the same computer?</h2>
<p>Yes. Both AeroFS icons will appear in the systems tray if you are using Windows or Mac. We are working on a way to differentiate between the two.</p>
<div>Keep in mind that installing both on the same device can take up quite a bit of disk space as files stored in Team Server is a copy of the files stored in your AeroFS client.</div>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What should I do if my Antivirus software flags AeroFS as a virus?</h2>
<p>If you've been browsing these forums and have gotten this far, you already know AeroFS isn't a virus. :)&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Anti-virus software such as Kaspersky and AVG agree with you and have whitelisted AeroFS, however at times they will still mistakenly prevent you from installation, or worse, silently delete AeroFS components. &nbsp;A common case is the removal of aerofsd.exe - if you are missing this and have AVG, it is very likely that AVG removed it.&nbsp;</span><br /><br class="kix-line-break" />We are in touch with these software companies, but as the progress of a fix is out of our hands, this is what suggest: quit your anti-virus software temporarily, reinstall AeroFS, then update the settings in the software to ignore AeroFS as a virus.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What kind of permissions does AeroFS need on my device?</h2>
<p>Please make sure you have read and write permissions to the parent of the AeroFS folder, not just the AeroFS folder itself.</p>
<div>For example, if your AeroFS is located at <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/AeroFS</code>, you must have read/write permissions to the<code>&nbsp;/Users/&lt;username&gt;</code>&nbsp;folder.</div>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What are the system requirements to run AeroFS and AeroFS Team Server?</h2>
<p class="p1">In general, AeroFS (both the desktop client and Team Server) runs on the following operating systems:<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP and later</li>
<li>OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard and later</li>
<li>Ubuntu 8.04 and later.&nbsp;While we don't officially support other Linux distributions, many users have reported successful installs in addition to Ubuntu.<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For OSX/Mac users, you need a processor that support 64-bit applications AND 64-bit version of Java. &nbsp;You can check what you have by doing the following clicking on the Apple menu &gt; About this Mac, and look at the processor. If it's an Intel Core 2 Duo or Xeon, then it should able to run 64 bits applications. If, on the other hand, it says "Core Duo" or "Core Solo" processor, then we're afraid you won't be able to run AeroFS.</p>
<p class="p1">OSX/Mac users will also want to check that your version of Java supports 64-bits. You can do this by going to Spotlight and running "Java Preferences". Under "General" you should see a setting for a 64-bit CPU.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">For Windows users,&nbsp;AeroFS now ships with its own version of OpenJDK. &nbsp;This streamlines the installation process and addresses both security concerns around a system-wide installation of Java, as well as compatibility issues when Java requires an update. &nbsp;The version of OpenJDK that is bundled with AeroFS is only accessible to AeroFS, and should not pose any security risk to the rest of your system. &nbsp;(We are working on doing the same on other platforms.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Any browser can access aerofs.com to manage folder invitations and devices, as well as install AeroFS on new devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">Please make sure that your browser cookies are *turned on* in order to navigate within aerofs.com.</span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What information is stored on the AeroFS servers?</h2>
<p>An important question we have to answer at AeroFS is how to keep track of file changes and maintain consistency without using a server. For example, when a file is changed, the system needs to guarantee that all other computers receive the change. In a server-based system, the computer that originates the change can simply tell the server about the change, which in turn tracks which computers have received the change and which have not. Without the server, however, keeping track of such information is extremely difficult, especially if any computer can goes offline or lost contact at any time.</p>
<p>We have developed a series of decentralized technologies to address these issues. As a result, AeroFS does not need a central server to keep computers in sync. However, in striving for a good balance between user experience and user privacy, we do maintain minimal information on our servers, so that even if all the computers belonging to a user are offline, the user can still set up new computers and join shared folders. The information stored on our servers includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The secure hash of the user's password, so that the server can verify the user's identity independently.</li>
<li>The user name, as well as the name of the user's computers, so that these data can be shown on the new computer's user interface immediately after setup.</li>
<li>Permissions of the folders shared with the user, so the computer can start syncing the folders with correct permissions immediately after setup or joining the folders. Shared folder names are also kept so AeroFS can show them on the user interface.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong><br />User data and even their metadata such as file names and directory structures are encrypted &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo;. That is, computers establish direct, secure connections using each other's security certificates, and send all data and metadata through these connections. This differs from the traditional approach where both peers establish a secure connection to a third-party server in the middle, which decrypts the data from one computer, and re-encrypts and forwards it to the other. End-to-end encryption guarantees that no &ldquo;middle-men&rdquo; are able to tap into the conversation at all.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Can I change the email address I am using for AeroFS?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately right now the only way to change your email address with AeroFS is to sign up as a new user.</p>
<p><span>If you'd like to sign up as a new user,&nbsp;</span><span>you can unlink your current devices (by clicking on the Taskbar icon, followed by Preferences -&gt; Unlink This Computer) and sign up under a new email address at http://www.aerofs.com/. Unlinking your device is safe and does not delete any data!</span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Does AeroFS work with XtraFinder or TotalFinder?</h2>
<p>XtraFinder and TotalFinder both happily co-exist with AeroFS. &nbsp;However, you will need to restart AeroFS while XtraFinder or TotalFinder already running to get the AeroFS Finder extension. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither program interferes with syncing or sharing, just be sure to start it last to access the right-click options.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>If I have identical files on multiple computers, will AeroFS sync all of them again?</h2>
<p>No, AeroFS will compare the files and once it determines that the files are indeed the same, it will not sync them again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When you install AeroFS on pre-seeded devices (i.e. with identical or almost identical content), AeroFS will not transfer the actual files. However, AeroFS still needs to transfer metadata to figure out that conflicting files are equivalent. For a variety of reasons, this process is currently much slower than we would like it to be and we are working on improving this with every new update.</p>
<p>Please note that in Recent Activities, you may still see entries such as "renamed and updated" for said identical files. These are created when AeroFS compares the files across your computers, and is an artifact of the algorithm we currently use to detect identical files. &nbsp;We know this can be confusing and will improve that in the near future. The content of these files is not transferred between devices that already have identical copies.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>what is stored in hidden folders ".aerofs.aux.######"?</h2>
<p>This hidden folder contains 3 folders: "h" "p" and "c."</p>
<p>The <strong>h/</strong> folder stores Sync History (formerly Revision History). You can safely delete files inside this folder directly or delete it from AeroFS &gt; Sync History. &nbsp;But once they are deleted you won't be able to restore any old revisions that you've deleted from this folder.</p>
<p>The<strong> p/</strong> folder stores partial downloads. You can safely delete these, but if AeroFS hasn't finished syncing the corresponding file yet, then it'll have to redownload the data.</p>
<p>The <strong>c/</strong> folder stores conflicting revisions - when two computers make concurrent changes to a file before they're able to sync up. You SHOULD NOT delete these yourself, but rather resolve the conflicts on the affected files through the "Help -&gt; Why aren't my files synced?" dialog.</p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Where are encryption keys stored and how do they get transferred between peers?</h2>
<p class="p1">Keys and certificates are stored in the AeroFS config directory locally, which is marked 'owners-only' on OSX and Linux operating systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">We perform a DTLS handshake between peers, and verify that 1) the remote peer's certificate is signed by the AeroFS root CA, and 2) that that peer is allowed to send/receive data for the specified shared folder.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"><a href="https://aerofs.com/security">More about AeroFS security&nbsp;here</a></span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>Would it be a good idea to move the "My Documents" folder into AeroFS folder?</h2>
<p><span>You can absolutely move My Documents under AeroFS to preserve the file structure that you created on Windows. &nbsp;Do this on one machine, and the AeroFS folder will sync and replicate that file structure across your other devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>How does AeroFS Team Server manage data between multiple Team Servers?</h2>
<div>As of 0.4.184 Team Server has 3 storage options upon installation:</div>
<div></div>
<div><ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Read/Write-able local storage</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Compressed and Deduplicated local storage</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">S3 storage</span></li>
</ol></div>
<div></div>
<div>If one Team Server runs out of storage space, it does not affect syncing to/from other Team Servers, nor does it affect other Team Servers syncing to S3. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Team Servers duplicate one another. And at present, you cannot choose which folders to sync to which Team Server if all are set up with the same account.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Clients and Team Servers prefer peers on LAN over other types of network connections. &nbsp;However if one machines is searching for a file, and a peer over wifi is available and has the latest file, it will connect to that one. &nbsp;Rather than waiting for a peer over LAN to come online.</div>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What are the AeroFS password requirements?</h2>
<p id="message_26904" class="msgText">AeroFS allows any ASCII characters, and passwords<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;must be at least 6 characters long.</span></p>
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>
<h2>What are the firewall requirements for the AeroFS Desktop Client?</h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">We strive to have AeroFS work across all types of firewalls and environments.</span></p>
<div class="article-body">
